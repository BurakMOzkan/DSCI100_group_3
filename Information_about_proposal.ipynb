    "# Group Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Students will work together in groups to complete a Data Science project from the beginning (downloading data from the web) to the end (communicating their methods and conclusions in an electronic report).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electronic report will be a **Jupyter notebook** in which the code cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. download a dataset from the web\n",
    "2. wrangle and clean\n",
    "3. summarize the data\n",
    "4. visualize the data\n",
    "5. appropriately answer a predictive question. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown cells** will be used throughout the document to narrate the analysis to communicate the question asked, methods used, and the conclusion reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate and answer a **predictive** question about the dataset using either **classification** or **regression**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our Data Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations for the proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group is expected to prepare a 1 page (max 500 words) written proposal that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. identifies the dataset they plan to work on,\n",
    "2. identifies the question they would like to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal should be done in a Jupyter notebook, and then submitted both as an **.html file** (File -> Download As -> HTML) and an **.ipynb file** that is reproducible (i.e. works and runs without any additional files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Each proposal should include the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Title**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide some **relevant background information** on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your proposal\n",
    "- Clearly **state the question** you will try to answer with your project\n",
    "- **Identify and describe the dataset** that will be used to answer the question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preliminary exploratory data analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate that the **dataset can be read from the web** into R \n",
    "- **Clean and wrangle** your data into a **tidy format**.\n",
    "- Using **only training data**, summarize the data in **at least one table** (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful table could be one that reports the number of observations in each class, the means of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis and how many rows have missing data. \n",
    "- Using **only training data**, visualize the data with **at least one plot** relevant to the analysis you plan to do (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful visualization could be one that compares the distributions of each of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain how you will conduct either your **data analysis** and which **variables/columns** you will use. Note - you do not need to use all variables/columns that exist in the raw data set. In fact, that's often not a good idea. For each variable think: is this a useful variable for prediction?\n",
    "- Describe at least **one way** that you will **visualize** the results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Expected outcomes and significance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you **expect** to find?\n",
    "- What **impact** could such findings have?\n",
    "- What **future questions** could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The submission appears to be self-contained and work flawlessly; any necessary libraries to install are made obvious that that the evaluator must install them. Student submitted an HTML rendering of an .ipynb notebook. The submission was a single file with all figures included.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mastery of the learning material is demonstrated, original ideas may be presented. The scientific question is well posed, creative and interesting. The correct method is proposed. Thesis is clear and the arguments that support it are flawless and very well-reasoned, leaving no obvious gaps. Structure of argument is very clear and straightforward; the reader almost never has to jump back and forth unless clearly instructed to do so by references.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No grammar or spelling errors are present. The submission is concise and to the point; the page, word or sentence count was respected."
